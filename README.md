# ExplainableAI: Algorithm Bias Detection

## Product overview

Algorithmic bias is a major concern in models predicting outcomes for people such as loan approval, hiring, committing crime in the future etc. Algorithmic Bias needs to be detected and corrected to ensure that historically disadvantaged groups are not being discriminated against. The solution utilizes bias metrics at different levels of strictness to identify demographic and statistical disparities in groups results.

## Product Highlight 

* The solution ascertains whether there is demographic disparity between outcomes for different groups and whether this disparate impact is higher than the legal threshold. The solution also identifies bias from a statistical parity point of view through the two most important metrics of bias: Equal Opportunity difference and Equalized odds difference. This informs whether there is parity in classification of deserving, and undeserving cases.

* The solution helps organizations incorporate Fairness in AI so they can ensure that predictions from AI algorithms do not give undue advantages or disadvantages to any group based on sensitive characteristics such as race, sex, income, age, religious beliefs etc. It also helps in adherence to fairness and equitable treatment requirements of regulatory authorities.

* PACE - ML is Mphasis Framework and Methodology for end-to-end machine learning development and deployment. PACE-ML enables organizations to improve the quality & reliability of the machine learning solutions in production and helps automate, scale, and monitor them.
